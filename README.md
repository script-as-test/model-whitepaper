# Script-as-Test Model: Whitepaper

This repository contains the official whitepaper of the **Script-as-Test (SAT) Model** — a collaboration model for managing automated test cases by treating test scripts as assets.

## 📘 What is the SAT Model?

The Script-as-Test Model promotes the idea that **test scripts should be the authoritative source of test cases**, and that they should be **automatically extracted, structured, and synchronized** into test management systems (TMS), such as Jira Xray.

This model is realized through the **SAT Framework**, which defines a standardized process to:

- Extract test case metadata from VCS (e.g., GitHub)
- Convert scripts into structured, traceable test cases
- Automatically synchronize test cases with TMS (e.g., Xray)

There are two implementations of this framework:

### 🔧 CLI Tool (Open Source)
